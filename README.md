As restaurants begin to open for in-person dining after COVID-related closures, touch-free menus accessible by QR codes have become common. However, more often than not, scanning one of these codes leads to a huge PDF file, forcing mobile users to zoom in 5x to read tiny menu text and make a decision for what they want to order. Even in print and on large paper, restaurant menus can sometimes seem unintuituve and difficult to navigate, leaving readers to flip back and forth between sections and pages with no clear path of navigation.

The rise of mobile menus gives restaurants an opportunity to simplify and redefine how menus are presented to guests, presenting menu content in a unidirectional layout that tells a story about the menu and its items. As guests scroll through the menu, items of interest can be saved - to be presented again at the end of the page, along with drink pairing suggestions (prompting further conversation with a waiter/waitress).

Content, flow, and story will change drastically from restaurant to restaurant.
